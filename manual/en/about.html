For educational purposes only.<br>
i created manual on my iphone.<br>
i downloaded an app called phpwin.<br>
phpwin self host localhost http php server.<br>
files app finds root folder for import & export webpages.<br>
i downloaded an app called working copy to export to github pages<br>
please remember i started from scratch before adding other open sources.<br>
i created an index.html file and created an index.log.<br>
i embeded the index.log file onto index.html page in an iframe.<br>
i then added open source js to tail the index.log<br>
meaning when we visit the manual page<br>
our connection is are the first to be seen in the log file<br>
this was better than having to scroll to see what was recent<br>
i added html username input form box below the embeded index.log file<br>
the html username input form box creates<br> 
a single webpage for each username input.<br>
for example if we type $1 and click enter<br> 
$1 will become $1.html in folder named en<br>
the url becomes http://localhost/manual/en/$1.html<br>
php also writes $1 in plain text on the webpage $1.html.<br>
php also writes each new link<br>
onto the webpage named manual.html<br>
creating a search engine results page for us<br>
when 1$.html already exist<br>
manual writes $1 onto $1.html in plain text.<br>
at the very center core of this website<br>
without any other open source things<br>
is just<br>
