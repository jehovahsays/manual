This is how I build my ai brain
if you already have an http web server 
with php installed drop this folder
in your root folder open your web
browser and visit the index.html
page. this is unfinished so that 
you all can make it work the way 
you need it to. 
you will need to understand html
css js and php computer language 
to change configurations.
read all of the files and edit them.

i was in hurry 
none of this is finished.
i have many other fields to help
out so this is for those of you 
starting from scratch with this.
